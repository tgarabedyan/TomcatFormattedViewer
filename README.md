<p>This is a simple, yet nice-to-have log viewer web-app for Tomcat.</p>
It simplifies browsing of the Tomcat logs, adding appropriate formatting and split content by logical parts.<br>
The current version (1.0) assumes that you didn't change log's formatting valve in server.xml file of your Tomcat server.<br>
Tested with Tomcat 9, but may works with any version if underlying JDK is 1.8+.<br>
