<h1>Tomcat&reg; Formatted Log Viewer</h1>
<p>This is a simple, yet nice-to-have log viewer web-app for Apache Tomcat Server.
It simplifies browsing of the Tomcat logs, adding appropriate formatting and split content by logical parts.<br>
Filter content of the log folder, combining common names and then available dates.</p>
The current version (1.2) assumes that:
<ul><li>you didn't change log's formatting valve in server.xml file of your Tomcat server, and</li>
  <li>log files are all located under <i>log</i> subfolder of CATALINA_BASE dir</li></ul>
Tested with Tomcat 9, but may works with any version if underlying JDK is 1.8+.<br>

<p><i>Sources are provided for free, if someone needs to modify the formatters or add new own features.<i></p>
