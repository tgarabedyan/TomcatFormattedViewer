This is a simple, yet nice-to-have log viewer app for Tomcat 9+. It simplifies browsing of the Tomcat logs, adding appropriate formatting and split content by logical parts.
The current version (1.0) assumes that you didn't change log's formatting valve in server.xml file of your Tomcat server.
Tested with Tomcat 9, but may works with any version if underlying JDK is 1.8+.
